# Example of sentiment analysis model for the deployment on Aista

The folder *developer upload sample 20201212* contains all the files that need to be uploaded to Aista.

  *clf.pickle* and *vectorizer.pickle* are model objects. 
  
	If you are interested in, the training of them can be found here [Jupyter](https://github.com/deenaariff/Starly/blob/master/jupyter-notebook/Integrated%20Master%20File_v8.ipynb/)
		
	More information about training the setiment model is here [Tutorial](https://medium.com/@aariff.deen/creating-a-real-time-star-prediction-application-for-yelp-reviews-using-sentiment-analysis-9c7e94978bf6.)
    
  *main.py* is the main script that process the input and call the model objects to give the output.
  
    The key point here is there should be a Model class in the script. In the Model class, there should be a main function which takes an input and gives the output.
    
  *requirements.txt* are packages will be installed in virtual environment on Aista. For this model, select python 3.6 when you upload the file.
  
  
After the deployment, you can use the following example in python to call the API. Here YourKey is provided by Aista to you. URLgeneratedAfterDeployments will be generated by Aista after the deployment.

```
  import requests 
  url = URLgeneratedAfterDeployments
  input = 'food is great'
  r = requests.post(url, json=input, headers={'X-API-KEY': <YourKey>})
  Item print(r.json())
```
